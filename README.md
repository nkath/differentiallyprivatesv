## Differentially Private SV

Implementation of a differentially private SVR and SVM. Differential privacy is achieved with output perturbation and objective perturbation (Chaudhuri et al. 2011)
and mini batch stochastic gradient decent for SVM.
Originally build to enhance https://www.info.kindai.ac.jp/~shirahama/rank_pooling/

## Features
- Differential privacy SVR/SVM
- Differential privacy version of SVC from sklearn
- MIA implementation (Salem et al.)
